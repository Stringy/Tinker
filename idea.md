# Ideas

- Legacy building like Crusader Kings. The whole idea being to build
  a strong nomadic family who continue your legacy and continue to move
  around and survive in the wilderness.

	- When you die you need to chose another member of the family to continue your legacy. You then play this character.

	- Some sort of skill inheritance system would be interesting. Perhaps if your father or mother was particularly strong then you're predisposed to being strong too? Needs some thought.

- RPG elements, with starting stats and some perks. e.g. a person who is particularly strong, or particularly smart. Or the opposite. I like Project Zomboid's approach to this, so it might be worth doing something similar.

	- Also skill, like fishing, woodcutting. They can be trained, or taught. Teaching is especially good for your children?

- Livestock, including moving them around with the group.

- Detail. Like DF & Project Zomboid. Maybe not quite that detailed. But detailed.

- Probably need to learn 2D art. Make some of my own resources. 

- NPCs
    - As part of the family/group
        - with their own agendas 
        - intelligent but uncontrollable 
    - Enemies
        - enemy groups, doing the same thing as the player's group
    - Friendly
        - Small villages / settlements
        - Wandering traders
        - friendly groups, doing the same thing as the player's group
