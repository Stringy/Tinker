# Tinker

My grand plan for this game is to distill the things I enjoyed about multiplayer minecraft down into
a single somewhat coherent game. My friends and I liked to go off on "expeditions" in which we ran away
from our base for many thousands of blocks at a time to explore and find resources, or villages, or whatever.
The fun bit was deciding what we'd take and then trying to survive as we ran from mobs, and ran out of food,
or found ourselves halfway across an enormous ocean with no land in sight.

The name is inspired by The Wheel of Time, where the Tinkers (or Tuatha'an) are a nomadic people who constantly
travel the world, following their pacifist lifestyle "The Way of the Leaf"

#### Aims:

- Survival
- Infinite procedurally generated world
- Resource gathering / crafting
- Reasons for the player to keep moving and not build a base
- Some level of base building despite the above
- NPCs, other wandering nomads, or villages. Hostile or friendly.

### The Story So Far

15/10/2021 - infinite flat world generation. It's not that efficient, but it works.
